### ES6 TUTORIAL

A collection of HTML files containing commented
[ECMAScript 6](http://es6-features.org/) code
divided by arguments.

The code should execute in any modern browser (tested on Chrome 68) and can be
changed by any editor to experiment with the language.

It uses some internal libraries to accomplish basic assertions, logging and
pretty printing.
