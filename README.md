### ES6 TUTORIAL

It's a collection of HTML files containing commented
[ECMASrcipt 6](http://es6-features.org/) code
divided by arguments. The code executes in the browser and can be
changed by any editor to experiment with the language.

The samples should run on any modern browser (tested on Google Chrome 68).

It's aimed at programmers already proficient in some C like
programming language.

It uses some internal libraries to accomplish basic assertions, logging and
pretty printing.
